## Notes

* GitHub org and repos allow others in the future to see what we’ve done
* Move to public GitHub repos for meeting notes, minutes, mission statement, etc. after we’ve figured out high-level strategy
* Discussing mission statement - trying to sum up the goal in one line.
* How specific or targetted should the mission be? Should it dictate solutions or just outcomes?
* Security important to communicate to client-side developers
* Scope to things we have control over
* Any produced specs or standards should be “living” (example https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)
* We should invite more people and aim for more diversity
* We should try to find a project name, share ideas and vote
* HAH : We should mention performance as a target as well for places with low internet access.
* DC: DMARC was a fairly recent, ad hoc spec and standardization effort (https://dmarc.org/)
