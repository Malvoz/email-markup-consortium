## Notes

### 1. Progress updates

- HAH: we have a shortlist of 4 name options for the group
- HAH: DS tested a [GitHub polling app](https://github.com/apps/polls) in an issue ([#12](https://github.com/email-standards/email-standards/issues/12)), but didn't work. HAH also tried in a private repo; same result.
- HAH: AL shared bullet points for mission statement benefits, charter, etc. in a Google Doc.

### 2. Name shortlist

- Listed the names in the [shortlist](https://github.com/email-standards/email-standards/issues/4#issuecomment-922236228) so far
- Attendees invited to add more options. None added. Agreed to finalise shortlist as is.

### 3. Voting process for group name

- Discussion among attendees: Google Forms (public option) vs Slack poll (private option)
- DS joins the call
- DS: Tested GitHub app AL shared last week. Did not work.
- DS: Slack poll app was disabled. Use emojis instead?
- All: agree to use Slack emojis and anonymity is not required.

### 4. Mission

- Using [Carin’s template](https://github.com/email-standards/email-standards/issues/3#issuecomment-914390862) we should get everyone’s input on who/what/why, then distill that into the final mission
- Back to Google Docs for commenting and editing process


### 5. Website

#### MVP website requirements ([#5](https://github.com/email-standards/email-standards/issues/5))

- EW: landing page with name, mission, contact info, how-to-get-involved info and perhaps a sign-up form to an email list
- Group email for contact info?
- HAH: set deadline to finalise the list of requirements?
- DS: we pretty much have it. Domain plus what EW suggested.

#### Next steps

- Open letter. Ability for visitors to sign.
- Discussion about hosting options.
- DS: GitHub pages is an option. More manual work.
- AL: can investigate Squarespace as an option
- DS: we'd need to check whether Squarespace is too limiting.

### 6. What else we need

- DS: password manager would be needed to share credentials among us
- DS: code of conduct is something we should add early
- DS: GitHub template? Custom one?

## Actions

- HAH: post Slack poll
- All: vote for group name in Slack channel. Deadline 28 September.
- All: Add any missing who/what/why to GitHub issue for mission statement
- DS: Find and share GitHub code of conduct template for editing/suggestions
